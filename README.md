# Expense Tracker

A simple Python project for managing financial expenses using object-oriented programming (OOP).
This is part of my Alt School First Semester Exam

## Overview

This project consists of two classes:  

- **Expense**: Represents an individual expense with attributes such as ID, title, amount, and timestamps.  
- **ExpenseDatabase**: Manages a collection of expenses, providing methods to add, remove, retrieve, and list expenses.

## Features

- Create an expense with a unique ID, title, amount, and timestamps.
- Update an expenseâ€™s title or amount while tracking the last update time.
- Add and remove expenses from the database.
- Retrieve expenses by ID or title.
- Export all expenses as dictionaries.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Clone the repository and run:
